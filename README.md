Mobile Android: Netrunner LCG Toolbox

**This is an experiment**, I enjoy web apps technologies and I wanted to do something that I know I'll use, so here it's: a mobile (online & offline) **Android: Netrunner LCG Toolbox**.

It's still under development, but my objetive is to create:
* A tournament organizer web app usable online and offline
* A portable Card DB reader with incorporated lightweight deckbuilder
